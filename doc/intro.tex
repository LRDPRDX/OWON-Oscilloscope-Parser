\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
If you have \textbf{OWON} oscilloscope you are probably able to use its official software
to communicate your scope with PC. That software, among others, allows user to record
waveforms from his/her device. Particularly, it allows to record data continuously (event
by event). In the latter case data is stored in binary files. However, it seems that
\textbf{OWON} doesn't provide any information about the structure (protocol) of those
binary files, and though user can read the data back by the software which produced it
(data), he/she is not able to use it for further (offline) analysis.
This software is intended to provide such possibility.

\Warning{This software is \emph{only} to work with the binaries obtained in \emph{auto-getting mode}}

Only oscilloscopes of the following models are verified to be parsed correctly with
this software:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TDS series
        \begin{itemize}
            \item TDS8204
        \end{itemize}
    \item SDS series
        \begin{itemize}
            \item SDS8302
            \item SDS6062
            \item SDS7072
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\Warning{If your oscilloscope is not in the above list you should consider to not use this
software: even if it is parsed without errors the content may be incorrect.
However, see section~\ref{sec:feedback}}
